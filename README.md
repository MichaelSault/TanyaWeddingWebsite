# Wedding Website

This project was created early 2024 to function as an RSVP system for my cousin's wedding.

It was built using Create React App, node.js and MongoDB.  The front-end was hosted partially on github pages and partially on Heroku.  The node.js server was hosted on Heroku in order to connect to the database on MongoDB Atlas.
This application also leveraged the Spotify API to allow guest to suggest songs for the wedding playlist.

An admin portal was also created to view and manage the RSVP system, but in heinsight should have been hosted on a different website as it created conflicts with the data flow and had to be toggled on and off as needed.

This project was retired after the wedding in August 2024, but I am working on a view only version as part of my portfolio.
